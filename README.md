# Overview

Gink is a versioned, eventually consistent, multi-paradigm database management system.
It takes a "protocol-first" approach, which facilitates multiple implementations
that can share data.  This repository contains the protocol buffer definitions for the
syncronization protocol, as well as two reference implementations: one in Typescript and
the other in Python.

Gink is free, open source software, and anyone may use it, fork it, etc.

This is *NOT* an officially supported Google product.
